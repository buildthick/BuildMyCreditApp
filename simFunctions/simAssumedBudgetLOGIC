1. LP = LoanPayments
2. CB = CardBalance
3. CardBudget =
    min(
      max(100, 0.055 * CB),
      max(100, 0.25 * LP)
    )

4. simAssumedBudget = LP + CardBudget

Meaning:
The assumed budget should be equal to loan payments, plus an amount of card balance.
The amount of card balance is the MINIMUM of 100 (the "floor") or 5.5% of card balance or 25% of loan payments.
That way the card payment used for the budget is never greater than 25% of loan payments.
